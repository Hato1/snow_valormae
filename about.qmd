Having completed her studies at the University of Canterbury, Snow Valormae’s musical style is an intriguing blend of various genres, including metal, rock, jazz, and classical.

Her academic journey was defined by a focus on extended range guitar performance and composition, particularly with the 8-string guitar. Snow embraced a diverse range of performance styles, studying jazz, classical, and contemporary approaches. Her compositional studies were centered on classical compositional philosophy and jazz harmony, which she used as foundational tools to write modern progressive contemporary music, creating a unique and innovative voice in her work.
