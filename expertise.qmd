    <p>I was looking for someone to help set up for drop tuning when I was put onto Snow. She did a great job of setting up my guitar, and it felt even better to play while being well set for accurate tuning for tracking an album worth of material. She had a bunch of really helpful tips, and offered any further adjustments if needed. I strongly recommend Snow if you're looking for help with your guitar!</p>
