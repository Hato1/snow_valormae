Snow is a reliable and dedicated tutor.\n\n\nVikki Hart – Parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow Valormae is a fantastic music teacher who has helped me understand guitar modes, tonality, and how to use them smoothly. She has greatly improved my sight-reading skills and taught me to recognize melodies and riffs in different genres, from pop to metal. Her explanations are clear and easy to follow, yet still detailed enough for more experienced players.\n\n\nFlynn Greaves – Guitar & Theory Student\n\n\n\n\n\nComposing and Arranging\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow composes intricate prog metal instrumentals for her solo project ‘Valormae’ and arranges complex jazz charts, blending technical virtuosity with creative expression. Her work spans dynamic compositions and detailed arrangements, showcasing a deep understanding of both genres. She has recently won an honorary mention award for her song ‘Anxious Atrium’ in the Instrumental section of the Unsigned Only song writing competition.  \n\n\nRig building (Pedalboards)\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow’s experience as a rig builder for guitar pedalboards includes expertise in soldering, MIDI programming, and understanding signal paths.

She did a great job of setting up my guitar, and it felt even better to play while being well set for accurate tuning for tracking an album worth of material. She had a bunch of really helpful tips, and offered any further adjustments if needed. I strongly recommend Snow if you’re looking for help with your guitar!\n\n\nRichie Jehan - Elidi\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformer\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow Valormae is a versatile performer, equally skilled in accompanying others and taking the spotlight with solo performances.
